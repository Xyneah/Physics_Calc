# Physics_Calc

I am making a webpage calculator with commonly used physics constants pre-programmed into it, that also displays the equation in LaTeX as one would write it. I attempted this a while ago for one of my intro programming classes, see physicsCalc_draft1.html, but it's buggy and in need of several improvements. Having had more practice writing code between then and now, I now see that my first draft was a hot mess of logic spaghetti. I'm starting over and this time making it a neatly layered logic sandwich.\n

As I was working on it, I thought about how wonderful it would be if I could lure in the odd unsuspecting physics student with a usefull tool, and offer then the chance to learn EXACTLY the code that runs it works. Or a fledgling programmer could see a relatively complex (compared to Hello World) program commented out with them in mind. Most of all, I want my code-phobic physics friends to have a positive experience exploring code while they procrastinate on their homework. This is why each function is EXTENSIVELY commented, give pointers to further reading, and I provide a text file with test scripts for each one of them for the user to test for him or herself.\n

~~~Where I Am Now~~~
Not very far. I am writing all the functions I will use to convert the user input to LaTeX notation for displaying in functions.js \n\n\n\n
