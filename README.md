# Physics_Calc

I am making a webpage calculator with commonly used physics constants pre-programmed into it, that also displays the equation as one would write it. I attempted this a while ago for one of my intro programming classes, see physicsCalc_draft1.html, but it's buggy and in need of several improvements. Having had more practice writing code between then and now, I now see that my first draft was a hot mess of logic spaghetti. I'm starting over and making a neatly layered logic sandwich.
